# Script for flexible /etc/*.d configuration
# From Atha, with a lot of improvements from truc - thanks!
# Generalized for /etc/*.d by Nicolas Bercher nbercher@yahoo.fr
#
# This script ideally goes into /usr/local/sbin and is called update-conf.d -
# you need to configure your <conf> entries in separate files in /etc/<conf>.d;
# only filenames starting with two digits are included!

# Examples: /etc/fstab.d/01base or /etc/hosts.d/61nfs-dm8000, to name just two.

## SETUP
# root of configuration files:
root="@CONFIGDIR@"
# script configuration path:
scriptconf="${root}/update-conf.d.conf"
# name of the configuration file to process:
conf="${1}"
# configuration file path:
confpath="${root}/${conf}"
# path to the backup of the current/previous configuration file:
bkpconfpath="${confpath}.d.bak"
# <conf.d> directory path:
dpath="${root}/${conf}.d"
# path to the intermediate location of the new configuration file based on
# <conf>.d/[0-9][0-9]* files:
dconfpath="${dpath}/${conf}"
# flag_verbose sets the verbosity level.
# Default is 1 (verbose output). If you want no messages set this to 0.
flag_verbose="1"
