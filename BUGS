  - I discovered that in current Debian testing (pre-8.0) a cleanup of
    util-linux has removed /etc/fstab.d from libmount. (atha)

  - I discovered that update-conf.d works without /etc/update-conf.d.conf on
    at least Debian testing (post-7.7 pre-8.0) -- the file is simply ignored
    and update-conf.d works as if <conf> was checked positively with
    /etc/update-conf.d.conf.
    This does not happen under Gentoo Linux... (atha)
