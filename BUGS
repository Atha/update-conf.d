  - I discovered that in current Debian testing (pre-8.0) a cleanup of
    util-linux has removed /etc/fstab.d from libmount. (atha) --FIXED IN DOCs

  - I discovered that update-conf.d works without /etc/update-conf.d.conf on
    at least Debian -- the file is simply ignored and update-conf.d works as
    if <conf> was checked positively with /etc/update-conf.d.conf.
    This does not happen under Gentoo Linux... (atha)
