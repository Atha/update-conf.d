INSTALLATION
============

Download it from GitHub:
  git clone git://github.com/Atha/update-conf.d.git
  cd update-conf.d

Run the following commands while in this directory:
1) make build
2) make install
   this will
   b) copy update-conf.d to /usr/local/sbin
   c) create an empty /etc/update-conf.d.conf (or touch if it should already
      exist)

IF YOU WANT a pre-configuration with /etc/fstab.d, you can also try the
following, but BE CAREFUL & USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:

Run the following commands while in this directory:
1) make build
   this will also copy your system fstab
2) make install-with-fstab
   this will
   a) create /etc/fstab.d/00fstab (your system fstab)
   b) copy update-conf.d to /usr/local/sbin
   c) create /etc/update-conf.d.conf with fstab as its only entry (DANGER! This
      will overwrite an existing version!)

If you want to be safe and test the installation, add a PREFIX directory to the
Makefile, like /tmp. You can test the installation from there. Note: you can do
this as a regular user, provided you have write access to the PREFIX directory.

You need to have write access to /etc and /usr/local/sbin in order to perform an
unprefixed installation. Login as root to perform a system wide installation.

BE CAREFUL AND USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!


UNINSTALLATION
==============

1) make uninstall
   this will remove /usr/local/sbin/update-conf.d from your system

However, your configuration directories, like /etc/fstab.d, will remain! You are
encouraged to edit your files manually to maintain a suitable and working
configuration.
Also, the configuration file /etc/update-conf.d.conf will remain. You may delete
it, if it is no longer of use.


USAGE
=====

Running "make install" will install the script and you will have to modulize the
file you want to have ".d-ed" by yourself.

Start by copying the desired file to a .d-ed directory.

This example assumes "/etc/hosts":

  cd /etc
  mkdir hosts.d
  cp hosts hosts.d/00hosts
  cd hosts.d

Now add "hosts" to your /etc/update-conf.d.conf file:

  echo "hosts" >> /etc/update-conf.d.conf

You can now test-run your set-up:

  update-conf.d hosts

You should see a similar output of the script:

--BEGIN-- SAMPLE OUTPUT --BEGIN--
hosts
/etc/hosts.d/hosts created, header added
Added: /etc/hosts.d/00hosts
Existing /etc/hosts renamed to /etc/hosts.d.bak
New configuration file /etc/hosts.d/hosts moved to /etc/hosts
--END-- SAMPLE OUTPUT --END--

Now it is time to modulize /etc/hosts.d/00hosts. You can have up to 100 seperate
configuration snippets for /etc/hosts, namely 00something to 99something. Any
other files will be ignored. Once you have finished, remove the original
00hosts or rename it, like .00hosts or hosts-original.


USAGE "install-with-fstab"
==========================

Using "make install-with-fstab" will result in a working installation for
/etc/fstab.d: you will see the file /etc/fstab.d/00fstab. You can now start to
modulize your fstab configuration.

In /etc/fstab.d, create files that start with two digits, like 01base and
02pseudo, that contain parts of your original /etc/fstab. You can easily add
files, like 10windows, 61nfs-nas or 99temporary.

The second step is to make sure that "fstab" is in your /etc/update-conf.d.conf
configuration file. Type:
  cat /etc/update-conf.d.conf

You should now get a list of names. After the installation, this is normally
only "fstab".

Now you can run the script, type:
  update-conf.d fstab

--BEGIN-- SAMPLE OUTPUT --BEGIN--
fstab
/etc/fstab.d/fstab created, header added
Added: /etc/fstab.d/00fstab
Existing /etc/fstab renamed to /etc/fstab.d.bak
New configuration file /etc/fstab.d/fstab moved to /etc/fstab
--END-- SAMPLE OUTPUT --END--

You can see that your new /etc/fstab contains only lines that are usable by the
system. Empty lines and comments were removed.

To add a new <conf>.d entry, simply type:
  echo <conf> >> /etc/update-conf.d.conf
or edit the file with your favorite editor.

Example:
  mkdir /etc/hosts.d
  cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.d/00hosts
  echo hosts >> /etc/update-conf.d.conf

Now edit some files in /etc/hosts.d:
  cd /etc/hosts.d
  cp 00hosts 01loopback
  cp 00hosts 02local
  cp 00hosts 10wins
  cp 00hosts 20apple
  cp 00hosts 61vpn
  cp 00hosts 99temporary

Edit these files so they only contain what the name suggests and so you don't
have any doubles.
Rename 00hosts:
  mv 00hosts hosts-backup
NOTE: Filenames that don't start with two digits, like hosts-backup, will not be
processed by the script. Since all your configuration for /etc/hosts should now
be in seperate files (01loopback to 99temporary) you will have all your
configuration lines available in the resulting /etc/hosts after running the
script.

Run the script:
  update-conf.d hosts
