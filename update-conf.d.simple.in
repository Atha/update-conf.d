# update-conf.d SIMPLE VERSION
# Version 2012-09-15
#
# Script for flexible /etc/*.d configuration
# Originally from Atha, with a lot of improvements from truc - thanks!
# Generalized for /etc/*.d by Nicolas Bercher nbercher@yahoo.fr
# Fixes by javeree
#
# The included makefile assists easy installation:
# "make clean" will clean previously built versions of this script.
# "make simple install" will build and install it.
# "make build install" builds and installs both versions.
#
# For installing, this script is copied into /usr/local/sbin and is called
# update-conf.d for both the SIMPLE and the COMPLEX version.
# However, you may find /usr/sbin a more suited place. (Edit the Makefile.)
#
# You need to configure your <conf> entries in separate files in /etc/<conf>.d;
# from the .d'ed directory only filenames starting with two digits are included!
# Other files are "inactive" which is the intended way of doing it.
#
# Examples: /etc/fstab.d/01base or /etc/hosts.d/61nfs-dm8000. If one is renamed,
# say to /etc/hosts.d/.61nfs-dm8000 or /etc/hosts.d/nfs-dm8000, it is ignored by
# the script i.e. inactive.

## SETUP
# scriptname:
scriptname=$(basename "$0")
# root of configuration files:
root="@CONFIGDIR@"
# script configuration path:
scriptconf="${root}/update-conf.d.conf"
# name of the configuration file to process:
conf="${1}"
# configuration file path:
confpath="${root}/${conf}"
# path to the backup of the current/previous configuration file:
bkpconfpath="${confpath}.d.bak"
# <conf.d> directory path:
dpath="${root}/${conf}.d"
# path to the intermediate location of the new configuration file based on
# <conf>.d/[0-9][0-9]* files:
dconfpath="${dpath}/$(basename ${conf})"
# flag_verbose sets the verbosity level.
# Default is 1 (verbose output). If you want no messages set this to 0.
flag_verbose="1"
