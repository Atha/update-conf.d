In January 2008 I wrote a very simple script to manage fstab entries in the way
like environment variables in /etc/env.d are managed. For this I created
separated fstab files in /etc/fstab.d and wrote a script called update-fstab
(that I would recommend going into /usr/local/bin).

I then released it in 2010 on the Gentoo Forum in the hope that it would be
useful to anyone. http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?p=6364143

Since then a few people have made enhancements, and the script is now even able
to handle any <conf>.d directory in the same way.

Note:
1) update-fstab - handles only /etc/fstab.d
2) update-conf.d - requires configuration file /etc/update-conf.d.conf

It is released under the terms of the General Public License version 2 (GPL-2)
or higher.

If you want to contribute: every improvement, fix, patch is welcome!
